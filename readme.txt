b. Camera: 1. Inside the camera class you will find a variable named fov, change this to change the fov in degrees.
           2. Use q and e to change elevation of the camera, and wasd to change the x and y coordinates, use the arrow keys to change the angle of the camera.
   Primitives: 1. Inside the class: "Scene", you will find a constructor method where you can add spheres and planes.
                  do note that if you create such a primitive, you will need to set the material and specularity seperately.
   Lights:     1. In the scene you can also add extra lights.
   Materials:  1. We support the full Phong shading, in setMaterial you can set in what amounts you want a primitive to be which material, glossy, reflective or diffuse.
                  You can set max bounces in the scene.
